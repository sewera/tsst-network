# TSST First Stage

IP/MPLS network emulator
IP is not necessary. We can assume that the packet coming out of a client is
an MPLS packet equipped with one label.
We focus on data and administration aspects.
What management actually is: FCAPS
F - fault - recognize, isolate, correct and log faults that occur in the network
C - configuration - make and store configs, plan future scaling
A - accounting - billing management
P - performance - ensuring that network performs at acceptable levels
S - security - access to network assets control

4 programs:
network node
client node
management system
cable cloud

Network node, e.g.:
commutation field
input/output port
management agent
others/helpers

Network configuration:
theoretically any configuration should be possible
for presentation configuration should be not so complex, but complex enough
to present full feature set
